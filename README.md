# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

This project uses SQL to analyze COVID-19 data from two tables: c_vaccine and c_death. The c_vaccine table contains information on COVID-19 vaccinations administered worldwide, while the c_death table contains information on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need access to the c_vaccine and c_death tables. These tables can be downloaded from the source website and imported into a local or cloud-based SQL database.


## Prerequisites

To run the SQL queries in this project, you will need:

* A SQL database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
* Access to the c_vaccine and c_death tables
* A SQL client or IDE (e.g. MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio)


## Running the Queries

To run the SQL queries in this project, open a SQL client or IDE and connect to your SQL database. Then, copy and paste the desired query into the client or IDE and execute it.

The queries in this project are organized by topic and provide insights into the COVID-19 situation worldwide, such as:

* The countries with the highest and lowest positive test rates
* The average number of new cases and tests by continent
* The correlation between hospital beds per thousand and total deaths per million
